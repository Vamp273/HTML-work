<!--The main difference between absolute and relative paths is that absolute URLs always include the domain name of the site with http://www. 
Relative links show the path to the file or refer to the file itself. A relative URL is useful within a site to transfer a user from point 
to point within the same domain.<br>
relative = which we access remotely means from our local sysytem
absolute = when we take link from other sources....-->
